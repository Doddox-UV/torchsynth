# ddsp-drum

A DDSP (differentiable) drum synthesizer

## Development Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/turian/ddsp-drum
cd ddsp-drum
pip install -e .
```

### Examples

We recommend that you run examples through Jupyter notebooks, and
that you have
[jupytext](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-jupytext-9234fdff6c57)
installed. It's a little fiddly to install, and those instructions
are the best. jupytext makes it easy to put demo notebooks into
the repo as Python files. (Larger assets like ipynb files we should
avoid.)
